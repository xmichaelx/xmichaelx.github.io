You can easily measure area of 2d shapes drawn or placed on a A4 sheet. 
I'll show how given few minor constraints and trade-offs you can do it in less than 30 lines of Python code.
At the end of tutorial I'll also discuss what you'll need to change in order to generalize this method a bit.

== Requirements

- Python 2.7
- SciPy
- Scikit-image

If you're using Linux or OSX you can probably already have Python. For other two dependencies you should follow: https://www.scipy.org/install.html and http://scikit-image.org/download.html.

On Windows whole procedure is a little bit more tricky. You will have to download Python and then install a lot of dependencies using this repo: http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs.
Or you can use Anaconda which is a Python distribution that comes with a lot of packages installed for you by default (including required ones). You can download it from here: https://www.continuum.io/downloads#_windows

You can check if everything is in place by opening python interpreting and importing some packages:

[[app-listing]]
[source,python]
.test.xml
----
from skimage import io,  color
from scipy.ndimage.measurements import label, sum
from skimage.morphology import convex_hull_image
----


If everything loads correctly it means we have the libraries we need in place and we can get down to work.

== Input data and some restrictions

We assume that the images we will be processing are scans of white A4 sheets of paper which have following dimensions: 210 mm Ã— 297 mm. 
This will provide us with a way of converting area from pixel count back to square milimetres depending on the resolution of the scans.

Another assumption we make is that shapes will be convex. What does that mean for us? 
It means that we will be able to use convex hulls to compute areas of the found shapes and the shapes won't be too complicated.

We will also require from the user to specify minimum size of the valid shape in pixels in order to filter out noise in the lighting of sheet.

Another thing that will be required will be the treshold value between 0 (black) and 1 (white) below which we will consider pixels to be not a part of background.

Below we present some sample images that will be used to test our code (coin and some hand-drawn shapes).
