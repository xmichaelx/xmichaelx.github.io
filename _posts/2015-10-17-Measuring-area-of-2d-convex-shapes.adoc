You can easily measure area of 2d shapes drawn or placed on a A4 sheet. 
I'll show how given few minor constraints and trade-offs you can do it in less than 30 lines of Python code.
At the end of tutorial I'll also discuss what you'll need to change in order to generalize this method a bit.

== Requirements

- Python 2.7
- SciPy
- Scikit-image

If you're using Linux or OSX you can probably already have Python. For other two dependencies you should follow: https://www.scipy.org/install.html and http://scikit-image.org/download.html.

On Windows whole procedure is a little bit more tricky. You will have to download Python and then install a lot of dependencies using this repo: http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs.
Or you can use Anaconda which is a Python distribution that comes with a lot of packages installed for you by default (including required ones). You can download it from here: https://www.continuum.io/downloads#_windows

You can check if everything is in place by opening python interpreter and importing following packages:

[source,python]
----
from skimage import io,  color
from scipy.ndimage.measurements import label, sum
from skimage.morphology import convex_hull_image
----


If everything loads correctly it means we have the packages we need in place and we can get down to work.

== Input data and some restrictions

We assume that the images we will be processing are scans of white A4 sheets of paper which have following dimensions: 210 mm Ã— 297 mm. 
This will provide us with a way of converting area from pixel count back to square milimetres depending on the resolution of the scans.

Another assumption we make is that shapes will be convex. What does that mean for us? 
It means that we will be able to use convex hulls to compute areas of the found shapes and the shapes won't be too complicated.

We will also require from the user to specify minimum size of the valid shape in pixels in order to filter out noise in the lighting of sheet.

Another thing that will be required will be the treshold value between 0 (black) and 1 (white) below which we will consider pixels to be not a part of background.

Below we present some sample images that will be used to test our code (coin and some hand-drawn shapes).

image:grosz.jpg[Grosz,300] 
image:shapes.jpg[Shapes,300]



== Python code step by step

Our application will have input parameter provided from console. We will require:

- path to the image file
- integer indicating minimum size in pixels for a shape
- float value between 0 and 1 as a threshold

In the following block of code we check if user provided all the required parameters and whether they have valid values:

[source,python]
----
import sys
import os.path

def main():
    if len(sys.argv) != 4:
        print("Input format: <filepath> <minimum size of detected shape in pixels> <threshold between 0 and 1>")
        return

    filepath = sys.argv[1]
    minimum_pixel_size = int(sys.argv[2])
    threshold = float(sys.argv[3])

    if not os.path.isfile(filepath):
        print("File does not exist: " + filepath)
        return

    if minimum_pixel_size < 1:
        print("Minimum pixel size has to be larger than 1 (probably much larger)")
        return

    if (threshold < 0) or (threshold > 1):
        print("Threshold value needs to be between 0 and 1")
        return

    # rest of the code will go here
    
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
----

Once we have a valid input we can begin the fun stuff.
First we need to load the image and turn it into grayscale:

[source,python]
----
image = io.imread(filename)
gray_image = color.rgb2gray(image)
----

Variable *gray_image* stores now grayscale image, each pixel has value in range from 0 to 1.
After this step we can treshold the image using provided treshold value:

[source,python]
----
binary = gray_image < threshold
----

Variable *binary* stores image where pixels have value 1 for shape and 0 for background.

Two images shown above now look like this for threshold value 0.8:

image:grosz_thresholded.jpg[Grosz thresholded,300] 
image:shapes_thresholded.jpg[Shapes thresholded,300]



[source,python]
----
segmented, num_segments = label(binary)
----

*label* is a function from *scipy.ndimage.measurements* package. 

It assignes unique integer values to continuous patches of non-zero pixels. 
Number of segments found is stored in *num_segments* variable. 
New image with shapes labeled is stored in *segmented* variable.
Labels have values from 1 to *num_segments*.


[source,python]
----
for i in range(1,num_segments+1):
    total_pixels_in_shape = sum(segmented == i)

    if total_pixels_in_shape > minimum_pixel_size:
        convex_hull = convex_hull_image(segmented == i)
        area = sum(convex_hull)
----

Next we iterate over each shape value, count the pixels and filter out shapes that don't have enough

    filename = sys.argv[1]
    minimum_pixel_size = int(sys.argv[2])
    threshold = float(sys.argv[3])

    if not os.path.isfile(filename):
        print("File does not exist: " + filename)
        return

    if minimum_pixel_size < 1:
        print("Minimum pixel size has to be larger than 1 (probably much larger)")
        return

    if (threshold < 0) or (threshold > 1):
        print("Threshold value needs to be between 0 and 1")
        return

    print("Reading image: " + filename + " ...")
    image = io.imread(filename)
    print("Converting to grayscale...")
    gray_image = color.rgb2gray(image)

    print("Thresholding image using threshold value: " + str(threshold) + " ...")
    binary = gray_image < threshold

    print("Labeling all shapes..." )
    segmented, num_segments = label(binary)

    print("Listing shapes found...")

    directory = os.path.splitext(filename)[0] # functions split path in two: file path and extension
    if os.path.exists(directory): # if directory with the name the same as file exists
        shutil.rmtree(directory) # delete it

    makedirs(directory) # create new one

    for i in range(1,num_segments+1):
        total_pixels_in_shape = sum(segmented == i) # get number of all pixels in shape

        if total_pixels_in_shape > minimum_pixel_size: # if there is enough of them
            convex_hull = convex_hull_image(segmented == i) # calculate convex hull
            area = sum(convex_hull) # and get number of pixels inside it
            print("Shape number: " + str(i) +  " shape area (in pixels): " + str(area))

            # pixels in convex hull are now either 0 or 1
            convex_hull = convex_hull * 255 # rescale each value so that they are  0 or 255 range (black or white in grayscale)
            shape_filename = directory + os.path.sep + str(i) + "_area_" + str(area) + ".jpg"
            io.imsave(shape_filename, convex_hull) # save under given filename
