You can easily measure area of 2d shapes drawn or placed on a A4 sheet. 
Given few minor constraints you can do it in less than 30 lines of Python code.

== Requirements

- Python 2.7
- link:https://www.scipy.org/install.html[SciPy]
- link:http://scikit-image.org/download.html[Scikit-image]

If you're using Linux or OSX you probably already have Python. For other two dependencies you follow instructions from their homepages.

On Windows whole procedure is a little bit more tricky. You will have to download Python and then install a lot of dependencies using this link:http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs[repo].

Alternatively you can use Anaconda which is a Python distribution that comes with a lot of packages installed for you by default (including required ones). You can download it from link:https://www.continuum.io/downloads#_windows[here].

You can check if everything is in place by opening python interpreter and importing following packages:

[source,python]
----
from skimage import io,  color
from scipy.ndimage.measurements import label, sum
from skimage.morphology import convex_hull_image
----


If everything loads correctly it means we have the packages we need in place and we can get down to work.

== Input data and some restrictions

We assume that shapes are link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polygon#Convexity_and_non-convexity[convex]. This will allow us to use convex hulls to compute areas of the found shapes.

We will also require user to specify minimum size of the valid shape (in pixels) in order to filter out artifacts produced by uneven illumination.

Another required parameter will be the treshold value above which we will consider pixels to be not a part of background. This value is in range 0-1 (0 is black and 1 is white).

Below are some sample images that will be used to test the code (coin and some hand-drawn shapes).

image:grosz.jpg[Grosz,300] 
image:shapes.jpg[Shapes,300]



== Python code step by step

Parameter are provided from console. Script requires:

- path to the image file
- integer indicating minimum size in pixels for a shape
- float value between 0 and 1 as a threshold

In the following block of code script checks if user provided all the parameters and checks their validity. The code itself is self-explanatory.

[source,python]
----
import sys
import os.path

def main():
    if len(sys.argv) != 4:
        print("Input format: <filepath> <minimum size of detected shape in pixels> <threshold between 0 and 1>")
        return

      filepath = sys.argv[1]
    minimum_pixel_size = int(sys.argv[2])
    threshold = float(sys.argv[3])

    if not os.path.isfile(filepath):
        print("File does not exist: " + filepath)
        return

    if minimum_pixel_size < 1:
        print("Minimum pixel size has to be larger than 1 (probably much larger)")
        return

    if (threshold < 0) or (threshold > 1):
        print("Threshold value needs to be between 0 and 1")
        return

    # rest of the code will go here
    
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

Once script has a valid input we can begin the image processing.
First script needs to load the image and turn it into grayscale. This is done using link:http://scikit-image.org/docs/dev/api/skimage.io.html#imread[imread] and link:http://scikit-image.org/docs/dev/api/skimage.color.html#rgb2gray[rgb2gray] functions.

[source,python]
----
image = io.imread(filename)
gray_image = color.rgb2gray(image)
----

Variable *gray_image* stores now grayscale image, each pixel has value in range from 0 to 1.
Next the script performs tresholding of the image using provided treshold value:

[source,python]
----
binary = gray_image < threshold
----

Variable *binary* stores image where pixels have value 1 for shape and 0 for background.

Two images shown above now look like this for threshold value 0.8:

image:grosz_thresholded.jpg[Grosz thresholded,300] 
image:shapes_thresholded.jpg[Shapes thresholded,300]


[source,python]
----
segmented, num_segments = label(binary)
----

link:http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.ndimage.measurements.label.html[label] is a function from *scipy.ndimage.measurements* package. 

It assignes unique integer values to continuous patches of non-zero pixels.
Number of segments found is stored in *num_segments* variable. New image with shape pixels labeled is stored in *segmented* variable.
Labels have values from 1 to *num_segments*.


[source,python]
----
for i in range(1,num_segments+1):
    total_pixels_in_shape = sum(segmented == i)

    if total_pixels_in_shape > minimum_pixel_size:
        pass # code for computing convex hull
----

Next script iterates over each shape found, counts the pixels and filters out shapes that don't have enough pixels (assuming they are artifacts produced by uneven illumination).
Then for each shape we select its pixels and calculate total area using link:http://scikit-image.org/docs/dev/auto_examples/plot_convex_hull.html[convex_hull_image] function 
and summing up all the pixels.


[source,python]
----
convex_hull = convex_hull_image(segmented == i)
area = sum(convex_hull)
----

Coin on the first image is a polish grosz, which has a diameter of 15,5 mm. Which gives area of 188,692 square milimeters. 
Using minimum size in pixels = 20 and threshold value = 0.8 we get area of coin roughly equal to 11771 pixels. 
Using those two values we can compute conversion factor between pixels and square milimetres, 
for this image one pixel is roughly equal to 0,016 square milimetres.

By using objects with well-known dimensions we can compute conversion factor for other shapes on the image. 
All we need to do is place a reference object with known or easily computable area.
