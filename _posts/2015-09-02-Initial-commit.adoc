This blog will be featuring programming tutorials and recipes. What kind of tutorials and recipes can you expect here?

- service and web-oriented C# - since I'm mainly a .NET developer
- Azure Cloud - since I heavily rely on it for my work (mainly Blob Storage, WebApps and Azure Queue)
- JavaScript and TypeScript
- some small Python projects doing fun stuff
- a little bit of other things

Some of the tutorials may also be written in polish for folks who have difficulty reading english tutorials. I guess that sums up my initial post. Roger out.
